> **Error** TS2792: Cannot find module '...'. Did you mean to set the 'moduleResolution' option to 'nodenext', or to add aliases to the 'paths' option?

This error can seem weird, as the TypeScript compiler sometimes complains about missing modules that don’t seem directly related to your project. It can be a non-blocking error i.e. the transpilation or other processes are not affected. It occurs when the compiler is not able to locate the required module. At times stack traces have not found to be helpful for me.

Nevertheless, there are a few options to resolve it. If you are not a project maintainer and you are seeing this error in a project/software that you are trying to run, then it is better to contact the project/software maintainer and ask them to resolve it. You could also try the below steps to fix the error yourself.

## Solution 1: Configure Compiler Options in `tsconfig.json`

The `moduleResolution` property specifies how the compiler tries to find the module that has to be imported. The value of the `moduleResolution` property depends on the value of the `module` property which specifies the import/export code style of the project.

If `moduleResolution` is misconfigured, you may encounter this error.

### Steps

1. Open the `tsconfig.json` file located in the root directory of your project. For example:

    ``` json {lineNos=inline, hl_Lines=["4-5"]}
    {
        "compilerOptions": {
            ...
            "module": "ESNext",
            "moduleResolution": "node",
            ...
        },
        ...
    }
    ```

    Ensure that the `module` property aligns with your project’s import/export style.

2. Update the `moduleResolution` property:

    - Set it to `node`. For example:

        ```json {lineNos=inline}
        "moduleResolution": "node"
        ```

    - If it’s not explicitly set, it might default to `classic`, which could be causing the issue.

3. Save the file and recompile your project:

    ```bash
    tsc
    ```

## Solution 2: Add Aliases to the `paths` Option

If configuring the compiler options doesn’t work, as a work around you can try installing the missing module and then adding aliases to the `paths` option in the `tsconfig.json` file.

### Steps

1. Install the missing module:

   ```bash
   npm install <module-name>
   ```

2. Add an alias in `tsconfig.json` under the `paths` option:

   ```json {lineNos=inline, hl_Lines=["7-9"]}
   {
       "compilerOptions": {
           ...
           "module": "ESNext",
           "moduleResolution": "node",
           ...
           "paths": {
                // example: "undici-types": ["./node_modules/undici-types/index.d.ts"],
               "<module-name>": ["./node_modules/<module-name>/<entry-file>"],
           }
       },
       ...
   }
   ```

3. Save the file and recompile:

   ```bash
   tsc
   ```

## Solution 3: Purge `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`

Sometimes, the error is caused by stale or corrupted dependencies.

### Steps

1. Delete the `node_modules` directory and `package-lock.json` file:

   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   ```

2. Recompile your project:

   ```bash
   tsc
   ```

If the issue persists, ensure that none of the parent directories of the project have a `node_modules` directory which could be causing conflicts. Then re-run the TypeScript compiler.

## Solution 4: Solution 3 + Reinstall Dependencies

If you have tried Solution 3 and it did not work, you can try reinstalling all dependencies.

### Steps

1. Run:

    ``` bash
    rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json && npm install
    ```

2. Compile again:

    ``` bash
    tsc
    ```

## Solution 5: Downgrade the Module in which the Error Occurs

If the error is caused by a specific module, you can try downgrading it to a version that is compatible with your project.

### Steps

1. Identify the problematic module:

    Check the error message to locate the module causing the issue.

    - Example: `node_modules/@types/node/globals.d.ts:473:25 - error TS2792: ...`

        Here, the issue is in the `@types/node` module.

2. Determine the compatible version:

   Refer to the module’s documentation, changelog, or issue tracker to find a version compatible with your project’s configuration.

3. Modify your `package.json` file:

    Add the module and its specific version to either ["dependencies" or "devDependencies"](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18875674/whats-the-difference-between-dependencies-devdependencies-and-peerdependencie), depending on how it’s used:

    ```json {lineNos=inline}
    {
        ...
        "dependencies": {
            ...
            "<module-name>": "<version>"
        }
    }
    ```

    or

    ```json {lineNos=inline}
    {
        ...
        "devDependencies": {
            ...
            "<module-name>": "<version>"
        }
    }
    ```

4. Install the downgraded module:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

5. Recompile your project:

    ```bash
    tsc
    ```

## Conclusion

I hope one of the above solutions helped you resolve the "Cannot Find Module '...' " error in TypeScript. ~If it did not, then quit TypeScript and go Rust!~
