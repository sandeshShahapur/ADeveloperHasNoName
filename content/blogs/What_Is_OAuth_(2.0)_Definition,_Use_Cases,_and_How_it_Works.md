## Why OAuth?
Before we dive into OAuth, let's understand why it is essential in the context of security. Every tool that humans create is done for fixing a problem, and OAuth is no different.

Let us consider a scenario where you have stored your media files (images, videos, etc.) on a cloud storage service like Google Drive. Now, you are using a media editing application and want to edit an image/video that is stored on your Google Drive. You don't want to download the file to your local system, edit it with the editing application, and then upload it back to Google Drive, because you find it inconvenient. Instead, you want the media editing application to directly access the file on Google Drive and make the necessary changes.

So, how can the media editing application access your files on Google Drive? The files are private and can only be accessed by you.
One way is to provide your Google Drive credentials (username and password) to the media editing application. But this is a security risk because the application can misuse your credentials or store them insecurely.
This is where OAuth comes into play. It provides a secure way for you to grant access to your Google Drive files to the media editing application without sharing your credentials.

In this way, OAuth enables communication between different services while maintaining the security and privacy of user data.

## 2.0? Are there different versions of OAuth?
In this guide, we will focus on OAuth 2.0, which is the latest version of the OAuth protocol. Other versions are OAuth 1.0 and OAuth 1.0a, which are now considered outdated due to security vulnerabilities and limitations.

## Definition
OAuth (Open Authorization) is a [protocol]( {{< ref "" >}} ) that allows a user to grant limited access to their resources on one site to another site without sharing their credentials.

## Use Cases of OAuth 2.0
OAuth 2.0 is widely used in various scenarios to grant access to user data securely. Some common use cases of OAuth 2.0 include:

1. **Social Login**: Users can log in to applications using their social media accounts like Google, Facebook, or Twitter (remember the "Log in with Google" or "Log in with Facebook" buttons?). As authentication is provided by the social media accounts, this eliminates the need to create a new account and remember another set of credentials.
It also lifts the burden of password management and security from the application owner.
    - It enables Single Sign-On (SSO): Users can log in to multiple applications using a single set of credentials.
2. **API Authorization**: Third-Party applications including plugins/extensions can access user data through APIs like Discord, Google Drive, Twitter, GitHub, etc.

## Components of OAuth 2.0

1. **Resource Owner**: The user who owns the data and grants access to it. In the Google Drive example, you are the resource owner.
2. **Client**: The third-party application or website that wants to access the user's data. In the Google Drive example, the media editing application is the client.
3. **Authorization Server**: The server that authenticates the user and issues Access Tokens. In the Google Drive example, Google Drive's authorization server.
4. **Resource Server**: The server that hosts the user's data and verifies Access Tokens. In the Google Drive example, Google Drive itself.

## How OAuth 2.0 Works
If the users don't share their credentials, how does OAuth 2.0 work? Through the term we mentioned earlier: "Access Tokens."
Access Tokens are like keys that allow the client to access the user's data without knowing the user's credentials. These tokens are short-lived and can be revoked by the user at any time. As they are short lived, we often use another key called the "Refresh Token" to get a new Access Token when the current one expires.

OAuth 2.0 works by following a series of steps to grant access to the user's data:

1. **Authorization Request**: The client sends an authorization request to the authorization server, asking for permission to access the user's data. The set of permissions requested is known as a "scope" (e.g., read-only access, read-write access, delete access).
    - Example: "Can I access this user's Google Drive files?"
2. **User Authentication**: The user authenticates with the authorization server and grants permission to the client. (**You should always check the scope of permissions requested before granting access**).
    - Example: You log in to your Google account and authorize the media editing application to access your Google Drive files.
3. **Access Token Request**: The client sends a request to the authorization server for an Access Token.
    - Example: The media editing application requests an Access Token to access your Google Drive files.
4. **Access Token Grant**: The authorization server issues an Access Token to the client.
    - Example: Google Drive issues an Access Token to the media editing application.
5. **Access Resource**: The client sends the Access Token to the resource server to access the user's data.
    - Example: The media editing application uses the Access Token to access your Google Drive files.
6. **Resource Access**: The resource server verifies the Access Token and grants access to the user's data.
    - Example: Google Drive verifies the Access Token and allows the media editing application to access your files.


## Conclusion
OAuth 2.0 is a powerful and secure protocol that allows users to grant access to their data without sharing their credentials. It is widely used in various applications and scenarios to provide a secure and flexible way to access user data. Understanding OAuth 2.0 is essential for developers who want to build secure and user-friendly applications that interact with third-party services.
