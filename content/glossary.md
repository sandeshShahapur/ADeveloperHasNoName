  protocol: "A set of rules and guidelines that dictate how participants (whether they are devices, software components, or users) in a system should behave."
  server: "A computer program or a device that provides functionality to other devices or programs, known as clients, by responding to their requests. These devices are typically dedicated to serving the needs of other programs or users, therefore being powerful machines which lack output devices like a monitor."
  web-server: "A server that hosts website component files (such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript files, images, etc.) and an HTTP server that processes incoming requests from clients (web browsers) and responds with the requested resources. Web servers are accessed through the domain names of the websites they host."
