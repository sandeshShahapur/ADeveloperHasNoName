Framework A collection of tools and libraries that help developers build applications more efficiently by providing pre-written code for common/boiler-plate tasks. Frameworks provide a structure for developing applications and enforce certain patterns and practices to ensure consistency and maintainability. Frontend The client-side/front-scenes of an application that is responsible for rendering the user interface and sending requests to the server (backend) for processing. HTML HyperText Markup Language is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. It describes the structure of web content using a system of tags and attributes. HTML elements are the building blocks of a website, e.g. headings (), paragraphs (), images (), links (), etc which can be nested inside each other. The browser reads the HTML file and renders the content on the screen. HTTP HyperText Transfer Protocol is the protocol that clients (browsers) and servers (Web-Servers) use to communicate website components like HTML, CSS, JavaScript files, images, etc. with each other over the internet. HTTPS HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure is the secure version of HTTP. It encrypts the data exchanged between the client and server, ensuring that it cannot be intercepted by unauthorized parties. HyperText A text that contains links to other texts. When you click on a link, you are taken to another text. Idempotent An operation that produces the same result no matter how many times it is executed. For example, a GET request is idempotent because it retrieves the same resource every time it is executed. Interface A shared boundary/layer between two entities (e.g., software components\rA {{\u0026lt; glossary term=\u0026#34;server-process\u0026#34; displayTerm=\u0026#34;server-process\u0026#34; ancestorTerms=\u0026#34;{software-component}\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} (e.g. a web server, database server, etc.), a client application (e.g. a website/browser, mobile app, desktop app, etc.), or a library/module that provides specific functionality to a software system.\r\u0026times;\r, devices, systems, etc.) that provides a means for them to communicate or interact with each other for exchanging information. It defines how access or interaction should occur between the entities. User-Interface The visual elements of a software application that users interact with, such as buttons, menus, forms, and other controls. It is designed to be intuitive, user-friendly, and responsive to user input. Internet It is like an intricate network of highways (data cables) connecting cities (servers) and towns (clients) across the globe. A network of network. It allows users to access and share information, resources, and services across the world and with each other. IP-Address An Internet-Protocol Address is a unique numerical label (e.g., 182.98.18.46) that identifies a device connected to the internet or a local network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. It is geo-locatable and can be used to identify the location of a device. JavaScript A high-level, interpreted programming language that is used to make web pages interactive and dynamic. It is used to create responsive, interactive elements on web pages, such as pop-ups, animations, form validation, and more. JavaScript is executed on the client-side (browser) and can interact with the Document Object Model (DOM) of a web page to update content, style, and structure. JSON JavaScript Object Notation is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is used to transmit data between a server and a web application as an alternative to XML. Library A collection of pre-written code that provides specific functionality to be used by other code.

Primarily, the manufacturer assigns it. They are often found on a device\u0026rsquo;s network interface controller (NIC) card. Markup-Language Systems for annotating a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text. The annotations typically define how the document should be structured, formatted, or displayed. They are static and do not have any logic or programming capabilities. Port A specific point of communication that allows a computer to send and receive data over a network. Ports are identified by numbers, and each port is associated with a specific protocol or service.

<dd>An Internet-Protocol Address is a <strong>unique numerical label</strong> (e.g., 182.98.18.46) that identifies a device connected to the internet or a local network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. It is geo-locatable and can be used to identify the location of a device.</dd>
<dt>JavaScript</dt>
<dd>A high-level, interpreted programming language that is used to make web pages interactive and dynamic. It is used to create responsive, interactive elements on web pages, such as pop-ups, animations, form validation, and more. JavaScript is executed on the client-side (browser) and can interact with the Document Object Model (DOM) of a web page to update content, style, and structure.</dd>
<dt>JSON</dt>
<dd>JavaScript Object Notation is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is used to transmit data between a server and a web application as an alternative to XML.</dd>
<dt>Library</dt>
<dd>A collection of pre-written code that provides specific functionality to be used by other code. Libraries are reusable and can save time and effort by allowing developers to use existing code rather than writing it from scratch. All the public methods and signatures forms the API of the library.</dd>
<dt>MAC-Address</dt>
<dd>A Media Access Control Address is a hardware identifier that <strong>uniquely identifies</strong> each device on a network. Primarily, the manufacturer assigns it. They are often found on a device&rsquo;s network interface controller (NIC) card.</dd>
<dt>Markup-Language</dt>
<dd>Systems for annotating a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text. The annotations typically define how the document should be structured, formatted, or displayed. They are static and do not have any logic or programming capabilities.</dd>
<dt>Port</dt>
<dd>A specific point of communication that allows a computer to send and receive data over a network. Ports are identified by numbers, and each port is associated with a specific protocol or service. For example, port 80 is commonly used for HTTP traffic, and port 5432 is used for PostgreSQL database connections.</dd>
<dt>‌</dt>
<dd>Can be described as an internal address within a host computer that identifies a program or process</dd>
<dt>Protocol</dt>
<dd>A <strong>set of rules and guidelines</strong> that dictate how participants (whether they are devices, software components, or users) in a system should behave.</dd>
<dt>Rate-Limit</dt>
<dd>A restriction on the number of requests a client (user or application) can make to a server within a specified time frame. Rate limiting is used to prevent abuse, protect against denial-of-service attacks, and ensure fair usage of resources.</dd>
