Access-Modifiers
A way to control the visibility, accessibility, and scope of 
    class

 members (
    variable

, 
    method

, etc.). They determine whether a member can be accessed from. Common access modifiers are public (accessible from anywhere), private (accessible only within the class), protected (accessible within the class and its subclasses), and default (accessible within the 
    package

).
Access Token
A string of alphanumeric characters (usually random) that is stand-In for the user&rsquo;s credentials that allows a user to access their applications/services, or allows other third-party applications to access the user&rsquo;s application/service data without exposing the user&rsquo;s credentials. Access tokens are short-lived and can be revoked by the user at any time, and needs to be refreshed periodically using 
    Refresh-Token

. If token is compromised, the user&rsquo;s credentials are not exposed, making damage minimal.
Algorithm
A set of well-defined instructions that are executed/performed in an order to perform a task or solve a problem (e.g., a recipe for baking a cake). They are the building blocks of Computer-Science which are used to perform calculations, data processing, and automated reasoning tasks.
API
Application Programming Interface is an 
    interface

 i.e. a shared-boundary/layer between two 
    software components

 that provides a means for them to communicate or interact with each other for exchanging information. It defines how access or interaction should occur between the two.
Argument
A value/
    variable

 that is passed to a 
    function

 when it is 
    called

. Functions can accept zero or more arguments, which are used as input to the function&rsquo;s code block. Arguments are used to customize the behavior of a function. They are also called parameters.
Authentication
The process of verifying the identity of a user or system to ensure that they are who they claim to be. It is commonly used to grant access to resources or services based on the user&rsquo;s identity.
‌
(Authenticate) To log in to a system/service by providing valid credentials (e.g., username and password, biometric data, etc.).
Authorization
The process of determining what a user or system is allowed to do or access. It involves granting or denying access/permissions based on the user&rsquo;s identity, role, or other attributes.
Backend
The 
    server-side

/behind-scenes of an application that is responsible for storing and handling data, interacting with 
    databases

, performing user operations, computations, etc. It processes 
    requests

 and sends back 
    responses

 to the 
    client

/
    frontend

.
Binary-Code
Unlike humans who use and understand variety of symbols/values (0-9, A-Z, special characters), a computer is a base-2 system that uses and understands only 
    bits

. Computers use binary code (a series of bits) to represent all data, instructions, and information (whether it&rsquo;s text, images, sound, etc. ). It is the most machine readable and least human readable form of data.
Bit
The smallest unit of data that represents a binary value, either 0 or 1. Basis for 
    binary-code

 and all computer operations. A group of 8 bits is called a byte which is the standard unit of data storage in computers.
Call
The process of invoking/executing a 
    function

. When a function is called, the program jumps to the function&rsquo;s code block, executes the code, and then returns to the point where the function was called along with the output (if any).
Cascading
A process in which an operation or set of operations is repeated multiple times, with the output of each operation becoming the input for the next operation.
‌
Applying a priority order when multiple rules target the same element. The &ldquo;cascade&rdquo; ensures that the most specific rule (or the last one defined) wins, allowing different styles to be combined smoothly. In 
    CSS

, inline &gt; internal &gt; external and id &gt; class &gt; element.
Cipher
An 
    algorithm

 used for 
    encryption

 and 
    decryption

 of data. It takes plain-text data and converts it into a secret scrambled code (
    ciphertext

), or vice-versa. It optionally uses an 
    encryption-key

/
    decryption-key

 to perform the operation. Examples include AES, DES, RSA, etc.
CipherText
The secret scrambled code produced by a 
    cipher

/
    encryption

-
    algorithm

 when plain-text data is 
    encrypted

. The cipher-text is unreadable without the correct 
    decryption-key

. Purpose is to keep information confidential and secure.
Class
A class is basically 
    encapsulation

 of data (
    state

) and behavior (
    method

s) into a single unit. However, it is abstract and is a blueprint/template. E.g., a class &ldquo;Car&rdquo; can have states like color, model, speed, etc., and behaviors like start(), stop(), accelerate(), etc. To have an actual car, you need to create an 
    instance

 of the class, called an 
    object

. Also known as an object factory. A fundamental concept in 
    OOP

.
Client
A device or software that accesses services or resources provided by a 
    server

 by making 
    requests

. Clients can be website/browsers, mobile applications, desktop applications, etc.
Client-Side
Things that happen on the 
    client

, e.g., rendering of the 
    user-interface

, handling user interactions and events, sending 
    requests

 to the 
    server

, computing, etc.
Cohesion
The degree to which the elements (like 
    variables

, 
    functions

) inside an entity (like a 
    class

 or 
    module

) are related to each other. High cohesion means that the elements inside the entity are closely related and work together to perform the same/single tasks. Low cohesion means that the elements inside the entity are not closely related and perform different/multiple tasks.
Contiguous
Continuous or adjacent, without any gaps/breaks/spaces in between. In the context of memory, it refers to a block of memory locations that are next to each other, forming a continuous range of addresses.

Compile
Computers cannot understand or execute 
    source-code

. Compilation is the process of translating the complete source code into 
    machine-code

 before the program is executed, opposed to 
    interpreting

. A 
    compiler

 is required only once, and the compiled code can be executed multiple times. Compiled languages are &lsquo;faster&rsquo; because the whole code is already translated.
Compiler
A program that 
    compiles

. It also checks for errors in the code, and optimizes the code for better performance. The output of the compilation process is an executable file that can then be run by the computer.
Compile-Time
The period when a program is being 
    compiled

. It precedes the 
    run-time

. Some languages only have a run time, as they are 
    interpreted

.
Coupling
The degree of interdependence between two entities (like 
    class

, 
    module

, 
    function

, etc.). High coupling means that the entities are closely related and depend on each other, making them harder to change independently. Low coupling means that the entities are loosely related and can be changed independently without affecting each other.
CSS

    Cascading

 
     Style Sheets
 
 is used for describing and styling the presentation of a document written in HTML. CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media. E.g., changing the color, font, size, spacing, positioning, and layout of elements on a web page.
Database
A structured collection of related data that is stored and organized in a way that allows for efficient retrieval, updating, and management. Databases are used to store information for applications, websites, and other systems.
data-hiding

A concept in 
    OOP

 that puts 
    encapsulation

 into good use by restricting the direct access of a 
    class

&rsquo;s 
    state

 from anywhere outside the class. It enforces a forcefield around the state by allowing only the class&rsquo;s 
    method

s to access and manipulate the state, and allowing access to state from outside the class only through these methods. It is achieved through 
    access-modifiers

. Forcefield helps in preventing misuse of the state, accidental changes, and ensuring data integrity. Provides 
    high-coupling

 by reducing the dependency on the internal state of the class, thus allowing interdependent components to be changed independently.

    Cascading

 
     Style Sheets
 
 is used for describing and styling the presentation of a document written in HTML. CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media. E.g., changing the color, font, size, spacing, positioning, and layout of elements on a web page.
Database
A structured collection of related data that is stored and organized in a way that allows for efficient retrieval, updating, and management. Databases are used to store information for applications, websites, and other systems.
data-hiding

A concept in 
    OOP

 that puts 
    encapsulation

 into good use by restricting the direct access of a 
    class

&rsquo;s 
    state

 from anywhere outside the class. It enforces a forcefield around the state by allowing only the class&rsquo;s 
    method

s to access and manipulate the state, and allowing access to state from outside the class only through these methods. It is achieved through 
    access-modifiers

. Forcefield helps in preventing misuse of the state, accidental changes, and ensuring data integrity. Provides 
    high-coupling

 by reducing the dependency on the internal state of the class, thus allowing interdependent components to be changed independently.

Databases are used to store information for applications, websites, and other systems. data-hiding A concept in OOP\rthat puts encapsulation\rinto good use by restricting the direct access of a class\r’s state\rfrom anywhere outside the class. It enforces a forcefield around the state by allowing only the class’s method\rs to access and manipulate the state, and allowing access to state from outside the class only through these methods. It is achieved through access-modifiers\r. Forcefield helps in preventing misuse of the state, accidental changes, and ensuring data integrity. Provides high-coupling\rby reducing the dependency on the internal state of the class, thus allowing interdependent components to be changed independently. ‘hiding’ is a misnomer, it is more about controlling access\nData-Structure A way of organizing and storing related data so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. A way of structurally uniting/grouping data by defining the relationship between the data. For example arrays\r×\r, LinkedLists\r×\r, Trees\r×\r, HashTables\r×\retc. Data-Type It specifies the type of data that a variable\ris allowed to store (\rstatically-typed\rlanguages) or the type of data that a variable currently holds (\rdynamically-typed\rlanguages). It defines the operations that can be performed on the data. Examples include integers, strings, booleans, functions\r, objects\r, etc. Decode The process of converting encoded\rdata back to its original form. Decoding is the reverse of encoding and is used to retrieve the original data from its encoded form. Decryption The process of converting secret scrambled code (\rciphertext\r) back into plain-text data. A cipher\r/\ralgorithm\ris used to decrypt the data (optionally with a decryption-key\r) to reveal the original message. Decryption-Key A secret value (random string of characters) that is used to decrypt\rsecret scrambled code (\rciphertext\r) back into plain-text data. The key is used by a cipher\r/\ralgorithm\rto perform the decryption operation. Discord A platform where you can chat, speak, stream with your friends or communities. A Discord server is like a big group space. Servers contain channels which are like chat rooms for a specific topic. You can also join voice channels to talk/stream. Discord bots are user interactable community-made programs that can help you manage your server, play music, moderate, play games, etc that you can add to your server. DNS The Domain Name System translates/resolves website domain names into IP Addresses\r, which are used by browsers as the locations to request\rwebsites/\rwebpage-components\rfrom the web-servers\rbearing those IP Addresses that hosts the files. It acts as the internet’s phone book, eliminating the need for users to remember IP addresses. DOM Before JS\r, web pages had little/no interactivity, the content, style, layout of the webpage could not be altered after it was loaded and rendered on the client\r(browser). Document object Model is a tree-like\r×\rdata-structure\rrepresenting the structure of a webpage through objects\rwhere each object represents a part of the page (e.g., elements, attributes, text, etc.). It allows JS to manipulate the content, layout, and style of the webpage on client-side\r. Thus, it is a programming interface\rfor webpages that enables interaction with the page’s content and structure, e.g. changing color theme, click/hover effects, animation effects, menu toggles, etc. Dynamically-Typed A programming language in which the data-type\ris associated with values and not with variables\r. The type of data is determined at runtime\r. The type of data a variable holds can change during the execution of the program. Less strict and more flexible than statically-typed\rlanguages. Examples include JavaScript, Python, Ruby, etc. Encapsulation In low-cohesion\rsystems, the data (\rvariables\r) and functions\rare scattered and not related. Encapsulation is the bundling/grouping of data and functions that operate on that data (i.e. those data and functions that are related) into a single unit, called a class\r. It is considered one of the four fundamental OOP\rconcepts. Encapsulation enables data-hiding\rand increases cohesion. Encode The process of converting data from one form to another, usually to ensure that it is compatible with a specific format/system, or to efficiently and properly transmit/store the data. Examples include URL encoding, base64 encoding, etc. Unlike encryption\r, encoding does not provide security or confidentiality. Encryption The process of converting plain-text data into a secret code (\rciphertext\r) to prevent unwanted people from reading it. A cipher\r/\ralgorithm\ris used to encrypt (optionally with an encryption-key\r) the data. The scrambled message can only be understood by someone who has the correct decryption key. Encryption-Key A secret value (random string of characters) that is used to encrypt\rplain-text data. The key is used by an encryption-\ralgorithm\r/\rcipher\rto convert the plain-text data into a secret scrambled code (\rciphertext\r). First-Class-Citizen In programming languages, it is a entity/\rdata-type\rthat can be treated like any other value or variable\r. It can be passed as an argument\rto a function\r, returned from a function, assigned to a variable as a value. In some languages, functions are first-class citizens, meaning they can be treated like any other value. This allows for more flexibility and power in the language. Framework A collection of tools and libraries\rthat help developers build applications more efficiently by providing pre-written code for common/boiler-plate tasks. Frameworks provide a structure for developing applications and enforce certain patterns and practices to ensure consistency and maintainability. Frontend The client-side\r/front-scenes of a application that is responsible for rendering of the user-interface\r, handling user interactions and events, sending requests\rto the server\r, computing. Function A block of code that performs a specific task or operation. They take arguments\r, perform computations/work, and optionally return output. Function themselves compiled\r/\rinterpreted\rinto a series of instructions (more nuanced when function includes metadata\ror is a more complex object\r). In some programming languages, functions are first-class-citizen\ri.e. they are nothing but a value which is a reference\rto the first instruction of the function (note possible nuances). High-Level Writing code that is easy to read and write for humans. It is abstracted from the details of the computer’s hardware and is closer to human language than machine-language\r. High-level languages are more expressive and less complex than low-level\rlanguages. However, they are less efficient and slower to execute than low-level languages and more work is required to convert them to machine code. HTML HyperText\rmarkup language is the standard Markup-Language\rfor creating web pages and web applications. It describes the structure and semantic meaning of web content using a system of tags and attributes. HTML elements are the building blocks of a website, e.g. headings (), paragraphs (), images (), links (), etc which can be nested inside each other. The browser reads the HTML file and renders the content on the screen. HTTP HyperText\rTransfer\rProtocol is the Protocol\rthat clients\r(browsers) and servers\r(\rWeb-Servers\r) use to communicate website components\rwith each other over the internet\r. HTTPS HyperText\rTransfer\rProtocol\rSecure is the secure version of HTTP\r. It encrypts\rthe data exchanged between the client\rand server\r, ensuring that it cannot be intercepted, read and understood by unauthorized parties. HyperText A text that contains links to other texts. When you click on a link, you are taken to another text. In the context of the web\r, it refers to web pages that contain links to other web pages. Idempotent An operation that produces the same result no matter how many times it is executed. For example, a GET request is idempotent because it retrieves the same resource every time it is executed. Instance An occurrence/implementation/realization (i.e. a concrete entity) of an abstract entity. In the context of object-oriented-programming\r, an instance is a specific object\r(concrete entity) created from a class\r(abstract entity). Each instance has its own unique data and can perform actions defined by the class. Instantiate The process of creating an instance\rof a class\rin object-oriented-programming\r. When a class is instantiated, a new object is created based on the class’s blueprint. Interface A shared boundary/layer between two entities (e.g., software components\r, devices, systems, etc.) that provides a means for them to communicate or interact with each other for exchanging information. It defines how access or interaction should occur between the entities. Internet It is like an intricate network of highways (data cables) connecting cities (\rservers\r) and towns (\rclients\r) across the globe. A network of network. It allows users to access and share information, resources, and services across the world and with each other. Interpret Computers cannot understand or execute source-code\r. Interpretation is the process of translating a line of source-code into machine-code\rAND then executing it BEFORE moving to the next line as opposed to compiling\r. The system will ALWAYS require an interpreter\rsoftware to execute the program. Interpreted languages are ‘slower’ because translation has to be done during run-time\rand every time the program is executed. Interpreter A program that interprets\r. IP-Address An Internet-Protocol Address is a unique numerical label (e.g., 182.98.18.46) that identifies a device connected to the internet\r, or a local network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. Being geo-locatable, it’s like a postal address for devices on the internet which helps in transmitting data efficiently between devices. JavaScript A high-level\r, interpreted programming language\rthat is used to make web pages interactive and dynamic. It is used to create responsive, interactive elements on web pages, such as pop-ups, animations, form validation, and more. JavaScript is executed on the client-side\r(browser) and can interact with the DOM\rof a web page to update content, style, and structure. JSON JavaScript Object Notation is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse\rand generate. It is used to transmit data between software components\ras an alternative to XML\r. While it is derived from JavaScript\r, it is language-independent. Library A collection of pre-written code that provides specific functionality to be used by other code. Libraries are reusable and can save time and effort by allowing developers to use existing code rather than writing it from scratch. All the public methods and signatures forms the API of the library. Low-Level Writing code that is closer to the computer’s hardware, it is like directly speaking to the computer in its own language making it more efficient and fast but less human readable. Involves giving very specific instructions about how the computer’s memory and processor should work. It can be more complex and harder to write than high-level\rlanguages. Lesser work required to translate the code into machine-code\r. Machine-Code Most fundamental language a computer can understand and execute directly without needing some ’translation’. Operates at hardware level i.e. consists of instructions (made up of binary code\r) that corresponds to a specific operation the CPU can perform; thereby being specific to a computer’s architecture. Also called machine-language/machine-code. It is the lowest-level\rprogramming language. MAC-Address A Media Access Control Address is a hardware identifier that uniquely identifies each device on a network. Primarily, the manufacturer assigns it. They are often found on a device’s network interface controller (NIC) card. Markup-Language Systems for annotating a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text. The annotations typically define how the document should be structured, formatted, or displayed. They are static and do not have any logic or programming capabilities. Memory-Address Computers have memory which stores data. When you want to access some data, the computer needs to know where exactly it is stored in memory. Thus every byte\rof memory has an associated unique address which locates the data. When the data in the memory is the address of another memory location, it is called a pointer\r. Memory is usually contiguous\r. MetaData ㅤData about data. It provides information about other data. A good example would be a .jpg file of an image you take with your camera. If you open that image in, say, Photoshop, you can view the data itself as being the visible image of the photo you took, and you could also view and even edit the metadata which includes information like name of the photographer, date and time the photo was taken, camera model, etc. Every file has metadata associated with it. Module Represents a distinct unit of code that serves a unique and specific purpose, it’s self-contained\rand can be reused again and again. When people talk about things like packages\r, or libraries\r, they are also talking about “modules”. It is used to mean “some self contained bit of code that does this one specific thing”. Namespace Consider two people with the same name in a room, it would be confusing to call out their name. To avoid this, you could say “John from the marketing department” and “John from the sales department”. This is what namespaces do in programming. They allow you to use the same name for different things without causing confusion and naming conflicts. For example, two libraries\rmight have a function\rwith the same name, but they can be distinguished by their namespace (e.g., com.example.library1.function() and com.example.library2.function()) so that you can use both in the same program. The reverse order of the organization domain name is a common way to create namespaces. Object An object is a real-world entity that has state\rand behavior\r. While class\ris an abstract entity, an object is its concrete entity, it is an instance\rof a class. For example, a class “Car” can have states like color, model, speed, etc., and behaviors like start(), stop(), accelerate(), etc. To have an actual car, you need to create an object of the class. Objects are the building blocks of OOP\r. OOP Object-Oriented-Programming is a programming paradigm that is based on the concept of “\robjects\r”. Real-World entities of a system are modeled as classes\rwhose instances\rcommunicate with each other to perform tasks. It allows for the organization of code in a way that is more modular, reusable, and easier to maintain. OOP include the concepts encapsulation\r, inheritance\r, polymorphism\r, and abstraction\rand principles like SOLID\r. Package A package is used to provide a higher level, logical organization unit by grouping related modules\r/\rclasses\r/\rinterfaces\rtogether that provide a set of functionalities/tools. They provide namespace\rand are nestable. Often used to distribute and manage code, reuse code, and manage dependencies. Parse The process of analyzing a string of symbols to determine its grammatical structure with respect to a given formal grammar. It is used in programming to convert data from one format to another, such as from a string to a data structure\r. For example, parsing JSON\rstring data into a JavaScript\robject\r, or parsing an HTML\rdocument into a DOM\rtree, etc. Pointer A variable\rwhose value is a reference\r. One use is that it is lightweight because it does store the actual whole data, but only points to location of data. Port A specific point of communication that allows a computer to send and receive data over a network. Ports are identified by numbers, and each port is associated with a specific protocol or service. For example, port 80 is commonly used for HTTP traffic, and port 5432 is used for PostgreSQL database connections. ‌ Can be described as an internal address within a host computer that identifies a program or process Protocol A set of rules and guidelines that dictate how participants (whether they are devices, software components, or users) in a system should behave. Rate-Limit A restriction on the number of requests a client (user or application) can make to a server within a specified time frame. Rate limiting is used to prevent abuse, protect against denial-of-service attacks, and ensure fair usage of resources. Reference A reference is a type of data value that is a memory-address\rof another value/data i.e. it indicates where some other data is stored. As it points to some other data, it is used to access that data. A variable that stores a reference is called a pointer\r. Refresh-Token An Access-Token\ris short lived, meaning on expiry user will have to re-authenticate\r. Refresh-Token is string of alphanumeric characters (usually random) that can be used to be issued with a new Access Token after the current Access Token expires. It is used to maintain the user’s session without requiring the user to re-authenticate while ensuring the Access Token is short-lived and thereby more secure. Response When a server\rreceives a request\rfrom a client\r, it figures out what the client wants, processes the request and answers back to the client. This answer is called a response. The response typically contains the requested data or information, along with a status code indicating the success or failure of the request. Request Often, it is the backend\rthat stores and handles data, performs operations, etc. The client\r/\rfrontend\rwhen it needs data or wants to perform an operation, it must ask the backend server\rto do so. This asking is called a request, often over the network. The server processes the request and sends back a response\r. Self-Contained Something that is independent and complete on its own, without needing external components/resources to function. Though it may still interact with or expose parts of itself to other components. Server A computer program or a device that provides functionality to other devices or programs, known as clients\r, by responding to their requests. These devices are typically dedicated to serving the needs of other programs or users, therefore being powerful machines which lack output devices like a monitor. Server-Process A program that runs on a computer an a specific port\rand listens for incoming requests from clients\rover a network. It processes these requests and sends back responses to the clients. E.g., a web server, database server, etc. These processes usually run on a server\rmachine. Server-Side Things that happen on the server\r, e.g., processing of requests, interacting with databases, etc. Socket Port + IP Address. Also known as a communication endpoint. ‌ A socket is one endpoint of a two-way communication link between two programs running on the network. Software-Component A server-process\r(e.g. a web server, database server, etc.), a client application (e.g. a website/browser, mobile app, desktop app, etc.), or a library/module that provides specific functionality to a software system. Source-Code The raw textual human-readable code of a computer program written by a programmer in a programming language. Computers do not understand this version of code, thus it needs to be translated into machine-code\rbefore it can be executed. Translation is achieved through the process of compilation\ror interpretation\r. State The characteristics of an object\rwhich represents what an object is or what it looks like. It is the data (stored in variables\r) that an object holds at a given point in time. Also called attributes/properties. It defines the object’s behavior\r. With a dog as an example object, its state would include its name, breed, age, color, etc. Statically-Typed A programming language where the data type\rof a variable\ris known at compile time\r. The data type of a variable is explicitly declared when the variable is created, and it cannot change during the program’s execution. Statically-typed languages are more strict and less flexible than dynamically-typed\rlanguages. Examples include C, Java, C++, etc. Style-Sheet-Language A language used to describe the presentation or formatting of a document written in a markup language\rlike HTML\r, typically defining how elements should be displayed or rendered across different media. Transfer Exchange of data between the client and server. UI User Interface, the visual elements of a software application that users interact with, such as buttons, menus, forms, and other controls. It is designed to be intuitive, user-friendly, and responsive to user input. User-Interface The visual elements of a software application that users interact with, such as buttons, menus, forms, and other controls. It is designed to be intuitive, user-friendly, and responsive to user input. UX User Experience, the overall experience of a person using a product such as a website or computer application, especially in terms of how easy or pleasing it is to use. URL A Uniform Resource Locator is a web address that specifies the location of a resource on the internet. It consists of a protocol (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS), a domain name (e.g., example.com), a path to the resource (e.g., /blog) and optional query parameters (e.g., ?id=123) to makeup a complete URL, e.g., https://example.com/blog?id=123. Variable When writing a program, often you will want to store data in memory for later use. Instead of explicitly using the memory-address\rto refer/access the data, you can give a descriptive name of your choice so that it gets associated with the data (alias) and allows you to access/refer to it through the name. This name is called a variable. The data it holds can be varied/changed. So, basically it is a container for storing data values by being an alias to the memory location. Values can be of different types (e.g., numbers, strings, objects, etc.) and sizes. WebPage-Components HTML, CSS files, JavaScript files, images, videos, etc. that make up a webpage. Related webpages make up a website, sharing a common domain name. Web-Server A server that hosts website component files (such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript files, images, etc.) and an HTTP server that processes incoming requests from clients (web browsers) and responds with the requested resources. Web servers are accessed through the domain names of the websites they host. XML Extensible Markup Language is a markup language that is commonly used to carry and describe data. It is a self-descriptive language that allows you to define your own tags and attributes. ",

<dt>URL</dt>
<dd>A Uniform Resource Locator is a <strong>web address</strong> that specifies the location of a resource on the internet. It consists of a protocol (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS), a domain name (e.g., example.com), a path to the resource (e.g., /blog) and optional query parameters (e.g., ?id=123) to makeup a complete URL, e.g., <a href="https://example.com/blog?id=123">https://example.com/blog?id=123</a>.</dd>

 to refer/access the data, you can give a descriptive name of your choice so that it gets associated with the data (alias) and allows you to access/refer to it through the name. This name is called a variable. The data it holds can be varied/changed. So, basically it is a container for storing data values by being an alias to the memory location. Values can be of different types (e.g., numbers, strings, objects, etc.) and sizes.</dd>

Web servers are accessed through the domain names of the websites they host.</dd>
<dt>XML</dt>
<dd>Extensible Markup Language is a markup language that is commonly used to carry and describe data. It is a self-descriptive language that allows you to define your own tags and attributes.</dd>
