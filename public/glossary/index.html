Access Token
A string of alphanumeric characters (usually random) that is stand-In for the user&rsquo;s credentials that allows a user to access their applications/services, or allows other third-party applications to access the user&rsquo;s application/service data without exposing the user&rsquo;s credentials. Access tokens are short-lived and can be revoked by the user at any time, and needs to be refreshed periodically using

                HyperText Markup Language is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. It describes   the structure of web content using a system of tags and attributes. HTML elements are the building blocks of a website, e.g.   headings (), paragraphs (), images (), links (), etc which can be nested inside each other. The browser   reads the HTML file and renders the content on the screen.
                &times;
            
        
    , typically defining how elements should be displayed or rendered across different media.
Transfer

UI
User Interface, the visual elements of a software application that users interact with, such as buttons, menus, forms, and other controls. It is designed to be intuitive, user-friendly, and responsive to user input.
UX
User Experience, the overall experience of a person using a product such as a website or computer application, especially in terms of how easy or pleasing it is to use.
URL
A Uniform Resource Locator is a web address that specifies the location of a resource on the internet. It consists of a protocol (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS), a domain name (e.g., example.com), a path to the resource (e.g., /blog) and optional query parameters (e.g., ?id=123) to makeup a complete URL, e.g., https://example.com/blog?id=123.
Web-Server
A server that hosts website component files (such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript files, images, etc.) and an HTTP server that processes incoming requests from clients (web browsers) and responds with the requested resources. Web servers are accessed through the domain names of the websites they host.
XML
Extensible Markup Language is a markup language that is commonly used to carry and describe data. It is a self-descriptive language that allows you to define your own tags and attributes.

It is used to create responsive, interactive elements on web pages, such as pop-ups, animations, form validation, and more. JavaScript is executed on the client-side (browser) and can interact with the Document Object Model (DOM) of a web page to update content, style, and structure. JSON JavaScript Object Notation is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is used to transmit data between a server and a web application as an alternative to XML. Library A collection of pre-written code that provides specific functionality to be used by other code.

                <span>HyperText Markup Language is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. It describes   the structure of web content using a system of tags and attributes. HTML elements are the building blocks of a website, e.g.   headings (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->), paragraphs (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->), images (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->), links (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->), etc which can be nested inside each other. The browser   reads the HTML file and renders the content on the screen.</span>

<dt>URL</dt>
<dd>A Uniform Resource Locator is a <strong>web address</strong> that specifies the location of a resource on the internet. It consists of a protocol (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS), a domain name (e.g., example.com), a path to the resource (e.g., /blog) and optional query parameters (e.g., ?id=123) to makeup a complete URL, e.g., <a href="https://example.com/blog?id=123">https://example.com/blog?id=123</a>.</dd>
<dt>Web-Server</dt>
<dd>A <strong>server</strong> that hosts website component files (such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript files, images, etc.) and an HTTP server that processes incoming requests from clients (web browsers) and responds with the requested resources. Web servers are accessed through the domain names of the websites they host.</dd>
<dt>XML</dt>
<dd>Extensible Markup Language is a markup language that is commonly used to carry and describe data. It is a self-descriptive language that allows you to define your own tags and attributes.</dd>
