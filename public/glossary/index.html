Access Token
A string of alphanumeric characters (usually random) that is stand-In for the user&rsquo;s credentials that allows a user to access their applications/services, or allows other third-party applications to access the user&rsquo;s application/service data without exposing the user&rsquo;s credentials. Access tokens are short-lived and can be revoked by the user at any time, and needs to be refreshed periodically using 
            Refresh-Token

                    A string of alphanumeric characters (usually random) that is stand-In for the user&rsquo;s credentials that allows a user to access their applications/services, or allows other third-party applications to access the user&rsquo;s application/service data without exposing the user&rsquo;s credentials. Access tokens are short-lived and can be revoked by the user at any time, and needs to be refreshed periodically using Refresh-Token. If token is compromised, the user&rsquo;s credentials are not exposed, making damage minimal.

It is used to maintain the user&rsquo;s session without requiring the user to re-authenticate while ensuring the Access Token is short-lived and thereby more secure.

Binary-Code
Unlike humans who use and understand several symbols (0-9, A-Z, special characters), a computer is a base-2 system that uses and understands only two digits, 0 and 1. A bit is the smallest unit of data and represents a binary digit (0 or 1). It uses binary code (a series of 0s and 1s) to represent all data, instructions, and information that the computer can understand and process. While it is used by

 Applying a priority order when multiple rules target the same element. The &ldquo;cascade&rdquo; ensures that the most specific rule (or the last one defined) wins, allowing different styles to be combined smoothly. In

Binary-Code
Unlike humans who use and understand several symbols (0-9, A-Z, special characters), a computer is a base-2 system that uses and understands only two digits, 0 and 1. A bit is the smallest unit of data and represents a binary digit (0 or 1).

            Cascading

            
                
                    A process in which an operation or set of operations is repeated multiple times, with the output of each operation becoming the input for the next operation. 
 Applying a priority order when multiple rules target the same element. The &ldquo;cascade&rdquo; ensures that the most specific rule (or the last one defined) wins, allowing different styles to be combined smoothly. In

Database
A structured collection of related data that is stored and organized in a way that allows for efficient retrieval, updating, and management. Databases are used to store information for applications, websites, and other systems.
Data-Structure
A way of organizing and storing data so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. Data structures define the relationship between the data, the operations that can be performed on the data, and the
